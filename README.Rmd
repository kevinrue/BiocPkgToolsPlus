The goal of `BiocPkgToolsPlus` is to demonstrate use of BiocPkgTools functionality to
study the composition the Bioconductor package ecosystem. This is meant
to learn about packages, identify trends and issues in package annotations,
and inform policies for package development and maintenance.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `BiocPkgToolsPlus` from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

```{r 'install', eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("BiocPkgToolsPlus")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/kevinrue/BiocPkgToolsPlus) with:

```{r 'install_dev', eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("kevinrue/BiocPkgToolsPlus")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get the names of packages annotated with a given set of [biocViews](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html).

```{r example, eval = requireNamespace('BiocPkgToolsPlus')}
library("BiocPkgToolsPlus")
get_packages_by_views(c("Spatial", "Transcriptomics", "SingleCell"))
```

## Citation

Below is the citation output from using `citation('BiocPkgToolsPlus')` in R. Please
run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite __BiocPkgToolsPlus__.

```{r 'citation', eval = requireNamespace('BiocPkgToolsPlus')}
print(citation('BiocPkgToolsPlus'), bibtex = TRUE)
```

Please note that the `BiocPkgToolsPlus` was only made possible thanks to many other R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.
